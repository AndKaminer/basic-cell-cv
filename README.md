## User Guide:

### Running the Tool:
The tool can be run from the command line. Two arguments need to be specified: the video file and the detector mode (for now, just use 0, since there are no other modes).
Just invoke the tool like you would a normal python command:
```
python application.py --file video.mp4 --dtype 0
```
